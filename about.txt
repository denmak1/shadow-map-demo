OpenGL and GLUT demo, with a distant anscestry from the
GeneratedGeometry XNA demo from creators.xna.com. By now, it doesn't
look that much like the original, except the rocks and texture image
files, now converted to ppm.

pebbles files are public domain by Morgan McGuire, distributed with
the G3D engine. These files were downsized from the original to
512x512 and converted to ppm. Also, the original greyscale bumps file
was converted to a normal map.

assn3.cpp has the initialization and startup code, as well as the
main drawing function, which calls drawTerrain from Terrain.cxx

View.cpp handles window and view changes. 

Input.cpp handles mouse motion and keyboard input. Both orbit the view
around the center of the scene.

Terrain.cpp loads and draws the terrain geometry.

ImagePPM.cpp is simple ppm reader/writer
